### 🎯 Current Status

**Current Progress**: Phase 6.1 (FastAPI Backend) - COMPLETED ✅
**Next Phase**: Phase 6.2 (Advanced API Features) - Ready to start

### 📊 Completion Summary

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Foundation & Environment Setup (100% Complete)
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Core AI Models & Services (100% Complete)
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Document Processing Pipeline (100% Complete)
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Vector Database & Storage (100% Complete)
- ✅ **Phase 5**: RAG Pipeline Integration (100% Complete)
- ✅ **Phase 6.1**: FastAPI Backend (100% Complete)
- ⏳ **Phase 6.2-6.3**: Advanced API Features & Documentation (Not started)
- ⏳ **Phase 7**: User Interface Development (Not started)
- ⏳ **Phase 8**: Testing & Quality Assurance (Not started)
- ⏳ **Phase 9**: Deployment & Documentation (Not started)

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. **View Current Status**: Check `planning/README.md` for the latest progress
2. **Work on Next Phase**: Open `planning/06_phase_6_api_development.md` for Phase 6.2
3. **Review Completed Work**: Browse completed phase files for implementation details
4. **Track Progress**: Each phase file includes completion summaries and metrics

### 📝 Benefits of Split Structure

- **Better Performance**: Smaller files load faster in Cursor
- **Easier Navigation**: Focus on specific phases without scrolling through large files
- **Clear Progress Tracking**: Each phase file shows completion status
- **Detailed Documentation**: Comprehensive implementation notes for each phase
- **Modular Planning**: Easy to update individual phases without affecting others
