This is a new test document to verify that document filtering works correctly.

The document filtering feature should allow users to select specific documents and only search within those documents when asking questions.

This document contains information about:
- Document filtering functionality
- How to select specific documents
- Testing the filtering feature
- Verifying that only selected documents are searched

The system should now properly store the document ID in the metadata and filter queries based on the selected document IDs.
