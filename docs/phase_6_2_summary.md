    content_type="application/pdf"
)

# Returns validation status with detailed information
{
    "is_valid": True,
    "errors": [],
    "warnings": [],
    "estimated_processing_time": 2.5,
    "supported_features": ["pdf_text_extraction", "page_metadata"],
    "file_extension": "pdf",
    "content_type": "application/pdf"
}
```

#### 2. Upload Progress Tracking
```python
# Real-time progress monitoring
progress = await upload_tracker.get_progress(document_id)

# Returns detailed progress information
{
    "document_id": "uuid",
    "status": "processing",
    "progress": 60.0,
    "current_step": "embedding",
    "estimated_time_remaining": 30.0,
    "error_message": None,
    "metadata": {...}
}
```

#### 3. Streaming Connection Management
```python
# Connection tracking with metadata
connection = await stream_manager.create_connection(
    connection_id="uuid",
    metadata={
        "query": "What is AI?",
        "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
        "ip_address": "192.168.1.1"
    }
)

# Automatic cleanup of inactive connections
await stream_manager.cleanup_inactive_connections(timeout_minutes=30)
```

#### 4. Cleanup Mechanisms
```python
# Document cleanup with dry-run support
result = await cleanup_manager.cleanup_documents(
    document_ids=["uuid1", "uuid2"],
    older_than_days=7,
    failed_uploads_only=False,
    dry_run=True
)

# Returns cleanup statistics
