# Planning Document Template Usage Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

This template is designed to work seamlessly with RepoTrackr's parsing engine. Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Copy the Template
```bash
# Copy the template to your project
cp planning/template-planning-document.md docs/plan.md
```

### 2. Customize for Your Project
Replace all `[placeholder]` text with your actual project information:

- **Project Name**: Your actual project name
- **Repository URL**: Your GitHub repository URL
- **Dates**: Actual start and target completion dates
- **Technology choices**: Your specific tech stack decisions

### 3. Update Task Status
Use the checkbox patterns that RepoTrackr recognizes:

```markdown
- [ ] Task not started (todo)
- [x] Task completed (done)
- [~] Task in progress (doing)
- [!] Task blocked (blocked)
```

### 4. Add to Your Repository
Place the document in one of these locations:
- `docs/plan.md` (recommended)
- `plan.md` (alternative)
- `README.md` (with plan section)

## üìã Template Sections Explained

### Project Overview
- Basic project information
- Timeline and status tracking
- High-level goals and objectives

### Development Phases
- Organized by development phases
- Each phase has clear tasks and deliverables
- Status tracking for each phase

### Technical Implementation

- Use consistent formatting throughout
- Keep the document updated regularly

## üîÑ Integration with RepoTrackr

### Automatic Parsing
RepoTrackr will automatically:
- Extract all checkbox tasks
- Calculate completion percentages
- Determine project status (green/yellow/red)
- Track progress over time

### Status Calculation
- üü¢ **Green**: ‚â•70% complete, no blocked items
- üü° **Yellow**: 30-69% complete, ‚â§1 blocked task
- üî¥ **Red**: <30% complete, >1 blocked task, or stale

### Real-time Updates
- Update task status in your markdown file
- Commit and push to GitHub
- RepoTrackr will automatically detect changes
- Dashboard will reflect new progress
