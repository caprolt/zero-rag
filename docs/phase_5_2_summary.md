## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Components

#### 1. PromptEngine Class
The central component that manages all prompt engineering functionality:

```python
class PromptEngine:
    - prompt_templates: Dict of specialized templates
    - safety_guidelines: Three-tier safety system
    - response_formats: Format customization options
    - query_type_classification: Automatic query categorization
    - response_validation: Quality and safety assessment
```

#### 2. QueryType Enumeration
Automatic classification of user queries:

```python
class QueryType(str, Enum):
    GENERAL = "general"           # General questions
    FACTUAL = "factual"           # What, when, where, who questions
    ANALYTICAL = "analytical"     # Analysis and explanation requests
    COMPARATIVE = "comparative"   # Comparison requests
    SUMMARIZATION = "summarization" # Summary requests
    CREATIVE = "creative"         # Creative and innovative requests
```

#### 3. Enhanced Data Structures
Extended RAGQuery and RAGResponse with validation support:

```python
@dataclass
class RAGQuery:
    query_type: Optional[QueryType] = None
    response_format: Optional[str] = None
    safety_level: str = "standard"  # standard, conservative, permissive

@dataclass
class RAGResponse:
    validation_status: str = "valid"  # valid, warning, error
    safety_score: float = 1.0  # 0.0 to 1.0
```

## üîß Implementation Details

### 1. Prompt Templates

#### Base Template
Comprehensive template with clear instructions and context handling:

```python
"You are ZeroRAG, an intelligent AI assistant that provides accurate, helpful, and contextually relevant answers based on the provided documents. Your responses should be:

1. **Accurate**: Based only on the information provided in the context
2. **Helpful**: Address the user's question directly and completely
3. **Transparent**: Clearly indicate when information is not available in the context
4. **Ethical**: Follow safety guidelines and avoid harmful content
5. **Well-structured**: Organize information clearly and logically

Context Information:
{context}

User Question: {query}

Instructions:
- Use only the information from the provided context
- If the context doesn't contain enough information, say so clearly
- Cite specific sources when possible
- Provide a comprehensive but concise answer
- Maintain a helpful and professional tone

Answer:"
```

#### Specialized Templates
- **Factual**: For precise, data-driven answers
- **Analytical**: For pattern analysis and insights
- **Comparative**: For structured comparisons
- **Summarization**: For concise summaries
- **Creative**: For innovative thinking and solutions
- **Fallback**: For when no context is available

### 2. Safety and Ethics Guidelines

#### Three-Tier Safety System

**Standard Level:**
- Avoid harmful, dangerous, or illegal content
- Respect privacy and confidentiality
- Provide accurate information only
- Maintain professional and respectful tone
- Avoid bias and discrimination

**Conservative Level:**
- Strictly avoid any potentially harmful content
- Be extra cautious with medical, legal, or financial advice
- Require explicit disclaimers for sensitive topics
- Prioritize safety over completeness
- Avoid controversial or polarizing topics

**Permissive Level:**
- Allow broader range of topics and discussions
- Provide more detailed and comprehensive responses
- Include more creative and exploratory content
- Maintain basic safety standards
- Allow for more nuanced discussions

### 3. Response Format Customization

Supported formats:
- **text**: Natural, flowing text response
- **bullet_points**: Organized list format
- **numbered_list**: Structured numbered format
- **table**: Tabular data presentation
- **json**: Structured JSON format
- **summary**: Concise summary format

### 4. Context Formatting

Enhanced context presentation with:
- Document numbering and identification
- Relevance scores for each document
- Chunk indices for source tracking
- Structured content organization
- Metadata integration

Example formatted context:
```
Document 1: ml_intro.txt (Relevance: 0.950)
Chunk: 0
Content: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence...

Document 2: ml_applications.txt (Relevance: 0.880)
Chunk: 1
Content: Machine learning is used in recommendation systems...
```

### 5. Response Validation

#### Validation Components

**Safety Validation:**
- Pattern-based harmful content detection

- Configurable safety thresholds

**Context Adherence:**
- Word overlap analysis
- Content relevance checking
- Source attribution validation

**Quality Assessment:**
- Response length validation
- Generic response detection
