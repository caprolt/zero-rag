This is a test document to verify that the upload and processing functionality is working correctly after the recent fixes. 

The document should be:
1. Uploaded successfully to the data/uploads directory
2. Processed into chunks by the document processor
3. Stored in the vector database for retrieval

This text contains enough content to create multiple chunks during processing, which will help verify that the chunking and vector storage is working properly.

The system should now handle the import issues that were causing the background processing to fail.
