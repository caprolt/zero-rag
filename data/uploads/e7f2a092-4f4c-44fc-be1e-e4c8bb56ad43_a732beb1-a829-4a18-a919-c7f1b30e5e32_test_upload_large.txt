This is a larger test document for upload testing. It contains more sample text to verify the upload functionality works correctly with documents that meet the minimum chunk size requirements. The document should be processed and stored in the vector database successfully. This additional content ensures that the text is long enough to create at least one chunk during processing. The system should be able to handle this document and create appropriate chunks for vector storage and retrieval.
