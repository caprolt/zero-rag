    This is a test document for the ZeroRAG system. It contains multiple sentences to test the chunking functionality.
    
    The document processor should be able to handle various text formats and create appropriate chunks for embedding.
    Each chunk should maintain semantic coherence while staying within the specified size limits.
    
    This paragraph contains additional information about the system's capabilities. The processor supports multiple file formats including TXT, CSV, and Markdown files.
    
    The chunking algorithm uses intelligent sentence boundary detection to ensure that chunks don't break sentences inappropriately. This helps maintain the semantic meaning of the content.
    
    Finally, this document includes metadata extraction capabilities that track file information, processing statistics, and performance metrics.
